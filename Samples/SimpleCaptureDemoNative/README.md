# Configuring the SimpleCaptureDemoNative application.

## IMPORTANT

This sample application is NOT configured with any credentials or provided configuration.  You will need to follow the steps below to configure the relevant settings for your environment.

SimpleCaptureDemoNative demos:
- Traditional sign-in to Capture
- Social sign-in (via Engage) to Capture
- Sign-in session management
- Registration (traditional and social)
- Native Authentication using Facebook, Google+, and Twitter
- REQUIRED: Facebook SDK version 4.20.2
- REQUIRED: Google Signin SDK 2.3.2
- REQUIRED: Fabric.io with TwitterKit 2.8.0

To run this demo with your own configuration:

1. Find janrain-config-default.plist
2. Copy it to janrain-config.plist
3. Edit the settings in the copy to reflect your Social Login and Registration Settings.
4. Edit the settings to include the correct form names as found in your flow file.
5. Make sure you have the OpenID AppAuth for iOS Libraries implemented/installed:

Due to Google's decision to not allow web-based authentication through webviews, support for web-based authentication for Google has been implemented using Google's recommended OpenID AppAuth (http://openid.github.io/AppAuth-iOS/) libraries.  These libraries are now a *required* dependency of the Janrain Mobile Libraries.

The OpenID AppAuth for iOS libraries (version 0.7.1 tested) can be installed using CocoaPods or as an Xcode Workspace library.  Please refer to this link for additional information on installing the OpenID AppAuth for iOS libraries: http://openid.github.io/AppAuth-iOS/ Make sure your project's "Linked Frameworks and Libraries" includes a reference to the OpenID AppAuth for iOS Library ("libAppAuth.a")

If you are linking to the OpenID AppAuth Library repo and not using CocoaPods you may need to add the OpenID AppAuth library source code location to your Xcode project's Build Settings -> Search Paths -> Header Search Paths value: example: `/GitHub/OpenIDAppAuth/AppAuth-iOS/Source` (use the "recursive" option if needed).

This sample application has been updated to use the Xcode Workspace library implementation method.  This *WILL* require re-linking of the libraries for your build environement. *NOTE:* You may have to convert your Xcode project to a workspace project if you do not want to use CocoaPods.

Once you have added the OpenID AppAuth libraries to your project or workspace the following settings will need to be added/updated in your application if you are planning on using Google as a web-based identity provider in your mobile application.  NOTE: These steps are not necessary if you are using Google Native authentication using the Google iOS SDK.

####Create an iOS Google OAuth Client####

Visit https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials?project=_ and find the project that correlates to the Google Web OAuth client that is being used with the *same* Engage application being used by the Janrain Mobile Libraries. Then tap "Create credentials" and select "OAuth client ID".  Follow the instructions to configure the consent screen (just the Product Name is needed).

Then, complete the OAuth client creation by selecting "iOS" as the Application type.  Enter the Bundle ID of the project (`com.janrain.simpledemo.example` for example, but you must change this in the project and use your own Bundle ID).

Copy the client ID to the clipboard or a location for future use.

####Update Janrain Library configuration####
Update your application's configuration (i.e. https://github.com/janrain/jump.ios/blob/master/Samples/SimpleCaptureDemo/assets/janrain-config-default.plist ) by adding/updating the following values:

`<key>googlePlusRedirectUri</key>
<string>com.googleusercontent.apps.YOUR_CLIENT_ID:/oauthredirect</string>
<key>googlePlusClientId</key>
<string>YOUR_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com</string>`

####Update your applications info.plist####
Open your application's' `Info.plist` and fully expand "URL types" (a.k.a. "CFBundleURLTypes") and replace `com.googleusercontent.apps.YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with the reverse DNS notation form of your client id (not including the `:/oauthredirect` path component).

Example:
`<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
    <array>
        <dict>
        <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
        <string>Editor</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>com.googleusercontent.apps.YOUR_CLIENT_ID</string>
        </array>
        </dict>
</array>
`

There is now an optional janrain-config.plist setting that allows you to define the OpenID Scopes that will be requested during the Google OpenID request process.  The full list of scopes available is as follows:

    <key>googlePlusOpenIDScopes</key>
    <array>
        <string>OIDScopeAddress</string>
        <string>OIDScopePhone</string>
        <string>OIDScopeEmail</string>
        <string>OIDScopeProfile</string>
        <string>OIDScopeOpenID</string>
    </array>

6. You will need to follow these steps for each native provider:
  * ###Facebook
    1. Download the Facebook SDK for iOS from this link:  https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios
    2. Follow *ALL* of the steps on this page *EXCEPT* for Step 2 (Create a Facebook App): https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/getting-started/  In order for the Janrain Social Login Server to validate the provided Facebook oAuth token, the token must be provisioned from the same Facebook application that is configured for the Janrain Social Login application.  In most cases, the developer would simply add an iOS App Settings configuration to the existing Facebook App.
    3.  Use this page as a starting point for implementing native Facebook Login:  https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/ios/v2.4
    4. Update the "SimpleCaptureDemoNative-Info.plist" file to use your Facebook App ID in the recommended places.  This should match the Facebook App ID that was used for configuring the Facebook provider in the Social Login Dashboard.
    5.  Make sure that the Permissions requested in the `logInWithReadPermissions` method include the required permissions.  In most cases these permissions need to mirror the Facebook app permissions configuration of the Engage Social Login application that is configured in the Janrain Social Login Dashboard.
    6.  Refer to the `RootViewControoler.m` file for an example of how this was done with the SimpleCaptureDemoNative application.

  * ###Google+
    1. Download the Google+ 2.3.2 SDK from this link: https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/sdk/google_signin_sdk_2_3_2.zip.  Refer to this link for additional information: https://developers.google.com/+/mobile/ios/getting-started
    2. Follow *ALL* of the steps on this page that involve the XCode project configuration and Google+ app configuration: https://developers.google.com/+/mobile/ios/getting-started  In order for the Janrain Social Login Server to validate the provided Google+ oAuth token, the token must be provisioned from the same Google+ application that is configured for the Janrain Social Login application.  In most cases, the developer would simply add an iOS App Client ID configuration to the existing Google+ App.
    3. Update the "SimpleCaptureDemoNative-Info.plist" file to use your Google+ App ID in the recommended places.  This should match the Google+ App ID that was used for configuring the Google+ provider in the Social Login Dashboard.
    4. Update the Google+ "GoogleService-Info.plist" file with your Google+ App Client ID and reversed Client ID.
    5. Update the "Classes/RootViewController.m" file to use your Google Client ID (Line 56).
    6. In the case of the SimpleCaptureDemoNative application the integration steps were implemented in the `RootViewControoler` files with minimal changes from the examples provided by Google at this link: https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/sign-in
    7. Make sure that the Scopes requested by the `GPPSignIn` singleton includes the required scopes.  In most cases these scopes need to mirror the Google+ app permissions configuration of the Engage Social Login application that is configured in the Janrain Social Login Dashboard.
    8. Refer to the `RootViewControoler.m` file for an example of how this was done with the SimpleCaptureDemoNative application.

  * ###Twitter
    1. Download the Fabric SDK from this link: https://get.fabric.io/ and include TwitterKit
    2. Configure your Twitter App: http://docs.fabric.io/ios/twitter/configure-twitter-app.html  In order for the Janrain Social Login Server to validate the provided Twitter oAuth token, the token must be provisioned from the same Twitter application that is configured for the Janrain Social Login application.  In most cases, the developer would simply add an iOS App Client ID configuration to the existing Twitter App.
    3. Update the "SimpleCaptureDemoNative-Info.plist" file to use your Fabric API Key and Twitter OAuth Client ID and Client Secret in the recommended places.  This should match the Twitter App ID that was used for configuring the Twitter provider in the Social Login Dashboard.
    4. Edit the "Classes/AppDelegate.m" file to update the application with your Twitter Consumer Key and Consumer Secret. (Line 99)
    5. In the case of the SimpleCaptureDemoNative application the integration steps were implemented in the `RootViewControoler` files with minimal changes from the examples provided by Twitter at this link: http://docs.fabric.io/ios/twitter/authentication.html
    6. NOTE: In most default cases Twitter will not return an email address for an end user. This may cause account merging or linking issues if your Registration user experience relies heavily on merged social profiles.  This use-case is typically addressed by forcing Twitter account holders to use the "Account Linking" functionality of the SDK.  Customer's may choose to work with Twitter to get their application white-listed so it will attempt to return an email address from a user profile.  However, email addresses are not "required" for Twitter accounts, subsequently there is still no guarantee that an email address will be returned.

7. Refer to the `RootViewControoler.m` file for an example of how this was done with the SimpleCaptureDemoNative application.

8. Make sure to add/update the following method in your AppDelegate.m file accordingly (You may not need to handle all the url scheme variations):

    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication
             annotation:(id)annotation
    {
        NSLog(@"openURL %@", url);
        if ([self.openIDAppAuthAuthorizationFlow resumeAuthorizationFlowWithURL:url ]) {
            self.openIDAppAuthAuthorizationFlow = nil;
            return YES;
        }else if(url.scheme != nil && [url.scheme hasPrefix:@"fb"] && [url.host isEqualToString:@"authorize"]){
            return [[FBSDKApplicationDelegate sharedInstance] application:application
                                                                  openURL:url
                                                        sourceApplication:sourceApplication
                                                               annotation:annotation];
        }else if(url.scheme != nil && [url.scheme hasPrefix:@"com.googleusercontent.apps"]){
            return [[GIDSignIn sharedInstance] handleURL:url sourceApplication:sourceApplication annotation:annotation];
        }else{
            return [self application:application
                             openURL:url
                             options:@{}];
        }
    }
